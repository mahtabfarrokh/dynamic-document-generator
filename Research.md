# Event-Driven Agent Orchestration for Dynamic Document Generation

## Asynchronous, Event-Driven Multi-Agent Collaboration

A modern approach to dynamic agent orchestration is to adopt an **asynchronous, event-driven architecture** for agent collaboration. In this paradigm, multiple AI agents communicate through an **asynchronous messaging system**, emitting and responding to events rather than following a fixed linear graph.

Recent frameworks like Microsoft’s **AutoGen v0.4** illustrate this pattern: AutoGen introduced a *robust, asynchronous, and event-driven architecture* to enable dynamic multi-agent scenarios. OpenAI’s experimental **Swarm** framework also follows similar principles, using lightweight agents and **handoff** events as core abstractions.

In an event-driven system, agents exchange messages or "events" asynchronously, supporting both event-driven triggers and traditional request/response interactions. This allows workflows to evolve at runtime, leading to **self-assembling agent graphs**.

## Benefits for Document Generation

- **Parallelism and Speed:** Agents can run concurrently, leading to faster end-to-end document generation.
- **Adaptability:** The workflow can change dynamically based on content and agent outputs.
- **Fault Tolerance:** If one agent fails, others can continue or recover without collapsing the entire pipeline.
- **Scalability:** New agents can be added easily without restructuring the entire orchestration.
- **Improved Collaboration:** Specialized agents (Writer, Reviewer, Compliance Checker) can coordinate based on real-time needs.

## Integration into FastAPI + LangChain (LangGraph) + OpenAI Setup

We can integrate event-driven orchestration into the current stack in two ways:

- **Framework-based:**
  - Use Microsoft AutoGen or OpenAI Swarm.
  - Agents are wrapped to listen for and emit events.
  - The orchestration layer handles event passing.

- **Custom async orchestration:**
  - Use Python’s `asyncio.Queue` for an event bus.
  - Agents are async tasks that react to events.
  - Maintain modularity and flexibility manually.

In both setups, OpenAI API calls (e.g., `gpt-4`, `gpt-4o-mini`) happen inside each agent's logic. We can still use LangGraph for agent internal flows but use event-driven triggering to activate them.

## Prototype Code Snippet: Async Event Orchestration

```python
import asyncio

# Shared event queue for agents to communicate
event_queue = asyncio.Queue()

async def agent_a():
    """Agent A: generates the header section and emits an event when done."""
    header_content = "<h1>Report Title</h1>"
    print("Agent A: Header generated.")
    await event_queue.put({"event": "header_done", "data": header_content})

async def agent_b():
    """Agent B: waits for header, then generates zoning section."""
    while True:
        event = await event_queue.get()
        if event.get("event") == "header_done":
            header = event["data"]
            print("Agent B: Detected header_done event.")
            zoning_content = "<div>Zoning section based on header.</div>"
            print("Agent B: Zoning content generated.")
            break

async def main():
    taskA = asyncio.create_task(agent_a())
    taskB = asyncio.create_task(agent_b())
    await taskA
    await taskB
    print("Document assembly complete.")

asyncio.run(main())
```

In a FastAPI app, you could trigger the `main()` function asynchronously when a document generation request comes in, and stream or store the output after all agent tasks complete.

## Conclusion

Event-driven agent orchestration provides:

- Higher parallelism
- Flexible, runtime-adaptive workflows
- Better fault tolerance
- Easier scaling and maintenance

Frameworks like **AutoGen** and **Swarm** demonstrate that real-world applications benefit from moving to event-driven architectures for complex multi-agent coordination. Implementing a lightweight event bus with `asyncio` also offers a custom path if minimal dependencies are preferred.

Moving to event-driven orchestration would allow the document generation pipeline to become faster, more resilient, and capable of handling complex dynamic workflows in production.
